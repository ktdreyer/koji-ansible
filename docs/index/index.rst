Welcome to Koji Ansilbe collection documentation
================================================

This site contains the documentation of several Ansible collections. Some of these can also be found on the `official Ansible docsite <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/>`_, while others are currently only found here, or maybe in some more places. You can find an :ref:`index of all collections documented here <list_of_collections>`.

The source of this page can be found `here <https://github.com/felixfontein/felix-ansible-docsite/>`_.
